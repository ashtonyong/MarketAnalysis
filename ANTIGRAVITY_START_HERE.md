# ANTIGRAVITY START HERE

## 👋 Welcome, Antigravity!

This is your starting point for working on the Volume Profile Tool.

### 📚 Context
We are building a professional-grade Volume Profile analysis tool.
The core engine (`volume_profile_engine.py`) and basic CLI (`volume_profile_cli.py`) are built.
Your goal is to expand this into a full ecosystem with visualizations, advanced patterns, and more.

### 🚀 Getting Started
1. **Read `FRAMEWORK_ARCHITECTURE.md`** to understand the high-level design.
2. **Check `ANTIGRAVITY_TASKS.md`** for your todo list.
3. **Run `example_antigravity_integration.py`** (once created) to see how code flows.

### 🛠️ Key Commands
- Analyze a ticker: `python volume_profile_cli.py analyze SPY`
- Run tests: `python test_engine.py` (if available)

### 🤝 Workflow
1. Pick a task from `ANTIGRAVITY_TASKS.md`.
2. Implement it.
3. Verify it works.
4. Update the task status.

Let's build something amazing! 🚀
